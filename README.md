# nvidia-shield-controller

 I've been a Shield owner for a few months now and loving it for the most part (other than a few spotty software issues). 
This is a Windows taskbar program to enable / disable the shield controller. 
This helps in cases where you hook your Shield up to the TV via HDMI, but still want to use a controller from your PC as the main input device.

Download .exe from: http://www.filedropper.com/showdownload.php/nvidiashieldcontroller
 
 To use:

- Run as administrator
- Right-click the shield taskbar icon and select 'enable shield controller' or 'disable shield controller'.
